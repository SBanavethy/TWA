# TWA

Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA) is part of a Saint Louis University interdepartmental collaboration designed to support those most at risk of incarceration in living fruitful, prison-free lives. SLUâ€™s initiatives engage the whole lifespan, including prevention, in-prison, and reentry services. Through research, information-sharing, and direct services in areas such as education, legal defense, life skills training, and employment placement, SLU seeks to address the root causes of crime by providing support and resources to those who all too often see no alternative.
